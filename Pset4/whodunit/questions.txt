*Q - What’s stdint.h?

*A - stdint.h is a header file that provides type definitions of integers of specific fixed widths to aid in code portability.
     Between 8, 16, 32, and 64 bits - signed and unsigned.

1.
*Q - What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?

*A - uint8_t is an unsigned integer type with 8 bits. It can store numbers of the range 0 to 255.
     uint16_t can store values of the range 0 to 2^16-1 (65,535).
     uint32_t can store values of the range 0 to 2^32-1 (4,294,967,295).
     int32_t is a signed integer, storing values from -2^31 to 2^31-1 (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647).

2.
*Q - How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?

*A - BYTE   - 1 byte      4 Bits
     DWORD  - 4 bytes    16 Bits
     LONG   - 4 bytes    16 Bits
     WORD   - 2 bytes     8 Bits

3.
*Q - What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."

*A - 0x4d42 (hex)
     BM (ASCII)

4.
*Q - What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?

*A - bfSize is the size of the bitmap file, in bytes. (includes padding and metadata)
     biSize is the size of the bitmap structure (ie. size of required frame buffer).

5.
*Q - What does it mean if biHeight is negative?

*A - Negative biHeight signifies top-down DIB, meaning the file begins at the upper left corner of the image, rather than bottom right.

6.
*Q - What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?

*A - biBitCount sets the bit depth in the bitmap info header.

7.
*Q - Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?

*A - Using fopen to read an infile will fail and return NULL if the specified file doesn't exist.
     Opening a file for writing can fail if proper permissions are lacking, or for other reasons (like bad filename).

8.
*Q - Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?

*A - The third argument is blocks - how many times to read a block of size n (arg 2).
     Since block size is set by the size of the file, we only need to read 1 block.

9.
*Q - What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?

*A - If the width of the scanline is 3, then at three bytes per pixel, that's 9 bytes per scan line.
     The answer is 3, because it will require 3 bytes of padding to make 12 bytes, which is a multiple of 4.

10.
*Q - What does fseek do?

*A - fseek changes the location of the file pointer. When reading a file, you have a pointer that indicates to a certain location
     within that file, kind of like a cursor in a text document.  fseek advances or rewinds the locus of that pointer.

11.
*Q - What is SEEK_CUR?

*A - SEEK_CUR is the current location of the cursor. SEEK_SET is the beginning of the file, and SEEK_END is the end of the file.
     Each may be used with fseek as a point of reference from which to designate an offset.
