*Q - What is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?

*A - Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is a 45 letter word reputed
     to be the longest in the English language. Relevantly, a TRIE -tree array-
     is a data structure that facilitates the traversal of vast indexes of data
     in constant time. In an implementation of this data structure, a search
     operation will never require more than a certain maximum number of steps -
     a number derived from the length of the data being queried. In the case of
     a dictionary, the maximum possible number of operations required to
     execute a word search might ostensibly be 45, because that is the length
     of the longest English word.

*Q - According to its man page, what does getrusage do?

*A - getrusage() appears to be a resource utilization monitor capable of
     reporting various measures of the computational time and memory usage of
     processes and threads.

2.
*Q - Per that same man page, how many members are in a variable of type struct
     rusage?

*A - The variable rusage points to struct which contains the resource usage
     data - A struct comprised of 16 members - 2 STRUCTs, and 14 LONGs.

*Q - Why do you think we pass before and after by reference (instead of by
     value) to calculate, even though we’re not changing their contents?

4.
*Q - Explain as precisely as possible, in a paragraph or more, how main goes
     about reading words from a file. In other words, convince us that you
     indeed understand how that function’s for loop works.

5.
*Q - Why do you think we used fgetc to read each word’s characters one at a
     time rather than use fscanf with a format string like "%s" to read whole
     words at a time? Put another way, what problems might arise by relying on
     fscanf alone?

*Q - Why do you think we declared the parameters for check and load as const
     (which means "constant")?
